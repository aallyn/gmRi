\usage{
env_data_extract(
  data.set = "OISST",
  dates = NULL,
  box = c(-77, -60, 35, 46),
  out.dir = here::here("data", "OISST_thredd_test"),
  mask = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.set}{Env data to extract (options = ERSST, OISST, MURSST)}

\item{dates}{If !NULL, subset full time series to specific dates. Dates should be specified
as dates = c("YYYY-MM-DD", "YYYY-MM-DD")}

\item{box}{If !NULL, crop rasters to sepcific box faster downloading and processing.
Box should be specified as box = c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax).}

\item{out.dir}{Directory to store resulting raster stack. Note, this will overwrite any rasters
with the existing name.}

\item{mask}{optional mask to trim data with}
}
\value{
stack.out Stack of daily OISST files and also saves the raster stack as a .grd file
in the output directory specified by out.dir
}
\description{
This function accesses webhosted satellite data and then downloads a subset of the
data based on dates and long/lat bounding box. After downloading the data, the function
processes it and saves it as one raster stack file.
Installs "ncdf4" and "raster" packages if not installed.

This function is helpful for getting fresh downloads from thredds. In most cases it is faster
to access the data that is stored in shared
resource locations.
